# Functional Reactive Spring :
![badabum](https://github.com/yiss/functional-reactive-spring/raw/master/documentation/capture.png)
## Motivation :
This repository is a demo application of the functional reactive programming using Spring Boot 2 and Thymeleaf.
It was created to show the new changes brought by Spring Framework 5 and Ofc Spring Boot 2 during my presentation in JUG Montpellier and Montpellier Tech HUB 17 Octobre 

## Description :
The application is a demo for an application that shows the prices of different cryptocurrencies.
For this tutorial, I chose only 3 (You know demo purposes only - Also the prices are random)

## Installation :
You either you have to have a MongoDB instance running on localhost, if not that's not a bad idea I got you ;)

`./mvnw clean install`

`./mvnw spring:run`

And then go to `http://localhost:8080`

And Enjoy!

I'll be updating this project to add more functionalities.
